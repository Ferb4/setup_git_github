#  GitHub DevOps Bootstrap Script

A bash script to **instantly configure Git and GitHub access** on a fresh Linux system (VM, laptop, VPS, etc.).  
Designed for **DevOps engineers**, developers, or anyone setting up a new OS.

---

## Purpose

This script:

- ✅ Installs Git, curl, jq, OpenSSH (if missing)
- ✅ Sets up your global Git username and email
- ✅ Generates a new SSH key (or uses your existing one)
- ✅ Offers to **automatically add the SSH key to your GitHub account** via API
- ✅ Configures Git to always use SSH (no password prompts)
- ✅ Tests SSH connection to GitHub to confirm success

---

##  Why It Matters

As a DevOps or developer, you often:

1. Reinstall or work on fresh Linux machines
2. Need to reconnect Git/GitHub quickly
3. Want a consistent, secure setup (no HTTPS password prompts)

This script helps you get there in **a single command**.
